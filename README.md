This was a challenge given by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca) to use the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/) to create a frontend interface. There was a style guide given with color and font info and a mockup to replicate.

The specifications were as follows:

```
Your users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an input field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Bonus: Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode
```

All specifications have been met in this project. The only pre-written content of any sort was the given index.html file, which I further edited to include the custom font.
